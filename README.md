This script is intended for me to configure an elementary OS workstation from a clean install after setting up the user account. The goal is to install a few packages for development work and set any display resolution settings if running from a VM with a scaled display.

Usage:

```bash
$ ./run.sh [--vm-mode]
```

TODO:

[ ] Set scaling factor
